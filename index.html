    <b>Authors: </b> Zhiyu Lin, Jiamin Zhong, Zihe Yang <br>
    <br>
    What Factors into people's decisions on attending events? We looked into Yelp events attendance patterns through classification models such as Random Forest, K-Means,Decision Trees, SVMs, and Naive Bayes, regression models including linear and logistic regression, as well as unsupervised learning methods such as topic modeling, association rule mining, PCA dimension reduction and hypothesis testing. Click on the link to see some interesting results and cool visualizations. <br>

    Online shopping websites are prone to scams. Many products claiming to be certain trademarked brands are actually fake, causing confusion and legal issues. Could customer reviews help? Take Vans sneakers for example, we scraped 17,000 customer reviews on Vans listings from taobao.com and built a text profile for this brand through Python packages (NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn). Turns out, machine learning models can catch the fake sneakers with an 87% success rate. <br>
