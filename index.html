    <br>
    <b>Authors: </b> Zhiyu Lin, Jiamin Zhong, Zihe Yang <br>
    <br>
    What Factors into people's decisions on attending events? We looked into Yelp events attendance patterns through classification models such as Random Forest, K-Means,Decision Trees, SVMs, and Naive Bayes, regression models including linear and logistic regression, as well as unsupervised learning methods such as topic modeling, association rule mining, PCA dimension reduction and hypothesis testing. Click on the link to see some interesting results and cool visualizations. <br>

    <br>
    Online shopping websites are prone to scams. Many products claiming to be certain trademarked brands are actually fake, causing confusion and legal issues. Could customer reviews help? Take Vans sneakers for example, we scraped 17,000 customer reviews on Vans listings from taobao.com and built a text profile for this brand through Python packages (NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn). Turns out, machine learning models can catch the fake sneakers with an 87% success rate. <br>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/zlin18/SurvivalAnalysisSupremeCourtDecisions/blob/master/Zhiyu%20Capstone%20Final%20Paper.pdf">Survival Analysis on Predicting the U.S. Supreme Court’s Decisions </a></b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Author: </b> Zhiyu Lin <b>Advisors: </b> Vittorio Addona, Patrick Schmidt <br>
    <br>
    The U.S. Supreme Court follows a doctrine “stare decisis”, meaning that they have to judge a case based on prior decisions. This doctrine ensures the Court’s accountability and legitimacy. Yet in the past 70 years, the Court has overruled almost 200 decisions (out of nearly 9,000 in total). When and why did this happen? Survival analysis models (studying the development of events over time) provided some statistical explanations including how the judges make decisions balancing the constraint of legal norms and their policy preferences. <br>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/zlin18/ANLY561DiscriminationProject/blob/master/561_poster_final.pdf">Model Comparison for Discrimination on National Origins </a></b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Authors: </b> Zhiyu Lin, Ning Hu, Tianxing Jiang, Kuiyu Zhu <br>
    <br>
    Algorithmic fairness has a profound impact on societies as algorithms start to dictate decision makings in almost every industry. Biased crime prediction algorithms could discriminate against black and Latino people, and poorly designed employment algorithms could discriminate against women in the job market. What about national origin?  Do machine learning algorithms implement socioeconomic discrimination against minority groups on the dimension of national origin? Turns out they do! We looked into the mathematical reasons why. <br>
